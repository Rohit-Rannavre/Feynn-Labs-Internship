This repository contains the projects I did as an intern with [Feynn Labs](https://feynnlabs.com/).

- **Internship Role**: Machine Learning Intern
- **Internship Duration**: October, 2022 to December, 2022
- **Internship Mode**: Virtual

### :zap: [AI Product/Service Ideation Task](https://github.com/Rohit-Rannavre/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2022/blob/main/Project%201:%20AI%20Product%5CService%20Ideation%20Task/Artificial%20Intelligence%20for%20Indentification%20of%20Indian%20snakes.pdf)
In this solo project, titled ***Artificial Intelligence for identification of Indian snakes***, I put forth the idea of building an android and/or web application to identify Indian snakes by means of AI. This service, if implemented successfully, will be very important in not only identifing the creatures but also in saving humans from snakes and vice versa.

### :zap: [Market Segmentation Analysis of the Indian Electric Vehicle Market](https://github.com/Rohit-Rannavre/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2022/tree/main/Project%202.1:%20Market%20Segmentation%20of%20Electric%20Vehicles%20in%20India)
During this 2nd project, I teamed up with four other members to work on the given problem statement: analyze the electric vehicles market in India using the Market Segmentation analysis and come up with a feasible strategy to enter the market by targeting the Geographic, Demographic, Psychographic, and Behavioral segments.

:diamonds: Key findings:
- ***Tesla, Audi, Volkswagen, Nissan, Skoda tops the list of EVs with the maximum number of models in the Indian automobile market.***
