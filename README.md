This repository contains the projects I did as Machine Leraning intern with Feynn Labs.

### :zap: [AI Product/Service Ideation Task](https://github.com/Rohit-Rannavre/Feynn-Labs-Internship-2022/blob/main/Project%201:%20AI%20Product%5CService%20Ideation%20Task/Artificial%20Intelligence%20for%20Indentification%20of%20Indian%20snakes.pdf)
In this project, titled ***Artificial Intelligence for identification of Indian snakes***, I put forth the idea of building an android and/or web application to identify Indian snakes by means of AI. This service, if implemented successfully, will be very important in not only identifing the creatures but also in saving humans from snakes and vice versa.

In this study task, I, along with four other team members, worked on Market Segmentation (MS), highlighted the key points theoretically and practically (using Python) that are vital to MS.
